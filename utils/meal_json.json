In a deep frying or sauce pan, heat the oil to about 375\u00b0 F. Form 2 T. of the mixture into a small patty and gently drop into the oil. Fry until medium to dark brown, turning over once. Fry several patties as a time, until the mixture is gone. (Do not add too many patties to oil at once or the temperature will drop.) Place 2-3 hot patties in pita bread halves with fresh lettuce, tomato, and cucumber to fill. Add a spoon of Tahini sauce on top (see Tahini dip recipe)."

        ],
        "instructions": "For the stuffing, thoroughly mix the beef, onions, rice (all uncooked), tomato sauce, salt and pepper. Prepare the grape leaves by removing them from the jar and placing in a colander that is sitting in another, larger bowl. Pour about 2 cups (or enough to cover) of boiling water over the leaves and let them sit in the water for a few minutes. Drain the water and gently pull apart the leaves one by one. To stuff the leaves, place one leaf on a clean working surface with the rough side up and the stem toward you. Pinch off the stem at the base. Place about 1 tablespoon of meat mixture on the leaf near the stem side. Roll the leaf over the stuffing, then fold in the sides, and finish rolling the leaf until completely rolled around the stuffing. Keep the roll tight. Set the rolled leaves in a large soup kettle side by side snugly so that the leaves do not unroll during cooking. After each layer, place a few pats of butter over the top and continue with the next layer until all the leaves are placed in the pan. Add the broth and lime juice to the pan and bring to a boil. Immediately turn down to low and let simmer for 45-60 minutes until tender."

With last 1 cup of flour, use hands or a stand mixer with a dough-hook attached to kneed dough for 1-2 minutes. Continue kneading and add remaining flour until dough is thick. (Dough will be slightly sticky.) Place dough into a greased bowl, turning to grease the top. Cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour, or until doubled in size. Punch dough down and divide in half. Shape each half into a loaf by first rolling out on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 9 by12-inch rectangle. From the short end, roll dough onto itself and tuck in ends. Place into a greased bread loaf pan seam-side down. Cover and let rise in a warm place about 1 hour or until doubled in bulk. Bake at 400 degrees for 30 minutes or until golden brown. Remove from pans immediately and cool on wire racks."

Scoop about 1 tablespoon of dough with a large spoon, and with another spoon, scrape and carefully drop into the hot oil. Place several balls of dough in oil and cook until light golden brown. Turn over and cook until all sides are golden brown. Remove from the oil with a slotted spoon and set onto a paper towel to soak up extra oil. Dip into cooled syrup as directed. While the dough is rising, in a small saucepan dissolve the sugar in the water and add the lime juice. Bring to a boil then turn down to medium. Let simmer for about 20 minutes, stirring often, until slightly thickened. Set syrup aside to cool completely. Dip cooked doughnut holes in cooled syrup and place all in a large mixing bowl. Pour extra syrup over the top. Serve warm or cold."
